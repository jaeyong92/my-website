  <h1>Welcome to my personal website.</h1>
  <p>I’m Jae-Yong, but you can call me Jae.</p>

<h2>Focus</h2>
<p>Adversaries can copy a product or steal a blueprint, but they can't replicate a superior organization's ability to execute or its industrial culture. It isn't the best product that wins, but the best process. <span class="stabilo">The organization <i>is</i> the product</span>. I build the operational engine that makes an organization superior - a resilient system designed to deliver and <span class="stabilo">sustain a decisive advantage</span>.

<p>If you're working on hard operational problems in national security, <a href="mailto:jaeyong.lee@alum.mit.edu">I'd like to hear from you</a>.</p>

<h2>Foundation</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>Operations Mindset</b>: My professional approach is built on the discipline I learned while growing up in a family of classical musicians and was forged during <span class="stabilo">my service in the Swiss Armed Forces</span>. This experience gave me an intimate understanding of military life, including its culture, its operational realities, and the logic that shapes them. It trained me to think about building <span class="stabilo">resilient systems</span> by ensuring operations strategy - from processes and information systems to manufacturing and supply chain resilience - is inseparable from financial rigor (corporate finance, unit economics, P&L) and locked in by compliance (ITAR, export controls, government contracting). This holistic systems-thinking is how I build and sustain a decisive advantage - a perspective that applies not only to my work as an operations leader but to the urgent challenge of <span class="stabilo">strengthening America's defense-industrial base</span>.</li>
  <li><b>Global Perspective</b>: As a third-culture kid now based in New York City - via Seoul, Zurich, Beijing, London, Boston, and San Francisco - I navigate complex international environments and operate effectively across cultures. My past experiences in high-stakes international settings, from security work at a refugee center during the 2011 Arab Spring to serving as a <span class="stabilo">diplomatic attaché in Beijing</span>, have sharpened this perspective. My <span class="stabilo">fluency in five languages</span> (English, French, German, Korean, and Mandarin) provides a nuanced understanding of global geopolitics, while my time in Beijing offered a firsthand view of statecraft: how governments operate, <span class="stabilo">how intelligence drives policy</span>, how foreign policy is executed, and the strategic interests that define great power competition.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Track Record</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>Current</b>: VP Operations at <a href="https://www.thordynamics.com/" target="_blank">Thor Dynamics</a>. I lead operations strategy and build the operational engine to deliver critical technology to the warfighter while meeting the rigorous demands of our government partners.</li>
  <li><b>Formerly</b>: security work, military service, diplomatic service, venture investing in robotics, co-founding a data science company, and operations and strategic finance at <a href="https://www.rivian.com/" target="_blank">Rivian</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Other</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>Education</b>: MIT Sloan MBA with a heavy focus on operations management; alum of the University of St. Gallen, with study abroad at Tsinghua University. I majored in business and information systems, but it was my political science courses - particularly in comparative political economy - that most shaped my career path.</li>
  <li><b>Miscellaneous</b>: Clarinetist, certified personal trainer, and former amateur boxer.</li>
