    <h1>Jae-Yong Lee</h1>
    <p>Operations. Strategy. National Security.</p>

    <h2>Thesis</h2>
    <p>Decisive advantage is not built on a superior product. It is built on superior processes. The organization <i>is</i> the product.</p>
    <p>I build the operational engine that fuses operations strategy, financial rigor, and high-stakes compliance (ITAR, export controls) to deliver and sustain that advantage.</p>
    <p>My focus is on hard operational problems in the American defense-industrial base.</p>

     <h2>Profile</h2>
     <p><b>Operations</b>: My focus is on building resilient systems encompassing the full operational lifecycle: from supply chain and manufacturing to critical post-deployment systems for long-term customer success. This is the core operational logic of the armed forces, and my service gave me an intimacy with its culture and realities. This systems thinking is how I build a decisive and sustainable advantage.</p>
     <p><b>Geopolitics</b>: A 'third-culture kid' (Seoul, Zurich, Beijing, London, Boston, San Francisco, NYC), my perspective was shaped in high-stakes international settings, from security work at a refugee center during the 2011 Arab Spring to serving as a diplomatic attaché in Beijing, which offered a firsthand view of how intelligence drives policy and statecraft. Fluency in five languages (English, French, German, Korean, Mandarin) allows me to operate and build consensus across complex international environments.</p>

<h2>Track Record</h2>
<p><b>Current</b>: VP Operations at <a href="https://www.thordynamics.com/" target="_blank">Thor Dynamics</a>.</p>
<p><b>Formerly</b>: security work, military service, diplomatic service, venture investing in robotics, co-founding a data science company, operations and strategic finance at <a href="https://www.rivian.com/" target="_blank">Rivian</a>.</p>
<p><b>Education</b>: MIT Sloan MBA with a heavy focus on operations management. Alum of the London School of Economics (MSc), University of St. Gallen (BBA) with study abroad at Tsinghua University. I majored in business and information systems, but it was my political science courses - particularly in comparative political economy - that most shaped my career path.</p>
<p><b>Other</b>: Clarinetist, certified personal trainer, and former amateur boxer.</p>
