  <h2>Bio</h2>
<div class="bio">

  <p>I’m currently the VP Operations at <a href="https://www.thordynamics.com/" target="_blank">Thor Dynamics</a>, a defense technology company specializing in directed energy systems for counter-drone applications. I lead our operations strategy and manage daily operations, vital for delivering advanced national security, military, and law enforcement solutions.</p>

  <p>Previously, I began my tenure at <a href="https://www.rivian.com/" target="_blank">Rivian</a> in Palo Alto with the strategy and corporate development team, focusing on strategic finance and contributing to the IPO. I then transitioned to the B2B team, where my focus shifted to sales & operations planning (S&OP), sales operations, manufacturing coordination, and RFPs for government sales within the automotive industry.</p>

  <p>My career began as a diplomatic attaché at the Embassy of Switzerland in Beijing, gaining direct experience in international relations and geopolitical analysis. I then transitioned into venture capital in London, focusing on early-stage investments (Seed, Series A, Series B) across technologies central to the global race for technological supremacy, such as robotics, sensor technologies, machine perception, SLAM, and autonomous vehicle technologies. I also co-founded a startup commercializing privacy-focused data science solutions.</p>

  <p>Beyond these professional experiences, my personal and professional ethics are deeply rooted in my upbringing in a family of classical musicians, further shaped by my experiences in the military and my work in security at a refugee center during the Arab Spring of 2011. This background has cultivated capabilities in risk assessment, crisis management, cross-cultural communication, and an acute understanding of human factors within high-stakes operational contexts, proving invaluable for strategic information gathering.</p>

  <p>Academically, I majored in business and information systems in college, though courses in political science – particularly comparative political economy – ultimately had the greatest impact on my career. At MIT, I focused on manufacturing, logistics, and supply chain management. My passion for aerospace and defense also led me to co-preside over the MIT Sloan Space Industry Club and serve as a fundraiser for the MIT Rocket Team.</p> </div>
