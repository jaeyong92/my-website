<h2>Bio</h2>

  <p><b>My worldviews</b> are deeply rooted in my upbringing in a family of classical musicians, further shaped by my military experience and my work in security at a refugee center during the Arab Spring of 2011. This background has cultivated capabilities in risk assessment, crisis management, and an acute understanding of human factors within high-stakes contexts. As a third-culture kid who has grown up, lived, and worked across Asia, Europe, and the US, I use my fluency in five languages to cross-reference how key players perceive events across distinct linguistic and socio-cultural frameworks.</p>  

<p><b>Currently</b>, I'm the VP Operations at <a href="https://www.thordynamics.com/" target="_blank">Thor Dynamics</a>, a defense technology company specializing in directed energy systems for counter-drone applications. I build and lead the company's operational engine. I specialize in the <i>how</i> - the essential counterpart to the <i>what</i> and <i>who</i> - which is vital for delivering advanced solutions for national security, military, and law enforcement.</p>

  <p><b>Previously</b>, I began my tenure at <a href="https://www.rivian.com/" target="_blank">Rivian</a> in Palo Alto with the strategy and corporate development team, focusing on strategic finance and contributing to the IPO. I then transitioned to the B2B team, where my focus shifted to sales & operations planning (S&OP), sales operations, order coordination with manufacturing, and RFPs for government sales within the automotive industry.</p>

  <p><b>Early in my career</b>, I served as a diplomatic attaché at the Embassy of Switzerland in Beijing, gaining direct experience in international relations and geopolitical analysis. I then transitioned into venture capital in London, focusing on early-stage investments (Seed, Series A, Series B) at the center of the global race for technological supremacy, such as robotics, sensor technologies, machine perception, SLAM, and autonomous vehicle technologies. I also co-founded and served as CFO for a privacy-focused data science startup and left after securing Series Seed funding.</p>

  <p><b>Academically</b>, I majored in business and information systems in college, though courses in political science – particularly comparative political economy – ultimately had the greatest impact on my career. At MIT, I focused on manufacturing, logistics, and supply chain management. My passion for aerospace and defense also led me to co-preside over the MIT Sloan Space Industry Club and serve as a fundraiser for the MIT Rocket Team.</p>
