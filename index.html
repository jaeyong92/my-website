<h2>Bio</h2>

  <p><b>As the VP Operations</b> at <a href="https://www.thordynamics.com/" target="_blank">Thor Dynamics</a>, a US defense technology company, I specialize in national security enablement. I build the company's operational engine - from manufacturing and supply chain to finance and compliance - to deliver critical directed energy capabilities to the warfighter. I scale the company's infrastructure to meet the rigorous demands of our government partners and ensure the secure, compliant delivery of advanced technology to the US defense industrial base.

<p><b>I ground my worldview</b> in the discipline I learned from a family of classical musicians and forged in military service. Serving in the Swiss Armed Forces gave me an intimate understanding of military culture, the operational realities service members face, and the principles of civil-military integration. As US defense strategy increasingly emphasizes working closely with allies and key partners, this firsthand experience offers a valuable perspective on strengthening the American defense industrial base. This background, combined with security work at a refugee center during the 2011 Arab Spring, taught me risk mitigation and mission execution, skills that now define my work.

<p><b>As a third-culture kid</b> who has grown up, lived, and worked across Asia, Europe, and the US, I navigate complex international environments and operate effectively across cultures. My fluency in five languages gives me a nuanced understanding of global geopolitics. I honed these skills as a diplomatic attaché at the Embassy of Switzerland in Beijing, where I gained direct insight into East Asia's strategic landscape from the unique vantage point of a US partner nation.

<p><b>My career</b> has centered on the operational challenges of scaling advanced technology. At <a href="https://www.rivian.com/" target="_blank">Rivian</a>, I started on the strategy and corporate development team, focusing on strategic finance and the company's IPO. I then moved to the B2B team, where I handled sales and operations planning (S&OP), manufacturing coordination, and government sales proposals. Before that, as a venture capital investor in London, I specialized in early-stage companies developing robotics, advanced sensors, machine perception, SLAM, and autonomous vehicle technologies. I also co-founded a data science startup, serving as CFO through its seed funding round and winning the LSE Entrepreneur of the Year award.

<p><b>Academically</b>, I majored in business and information systems, but it was my political science courses - particularly in comparative political economy - that most shaped my career path. At MIT, I focused my MBA on supply chain, manufacturing, and logistics management. A passion for aerospace and defense also led me to co-preside over the MIT Sloan Space Industry Club and serve as a fundraiser for the MIT Rocket Team.</p>
