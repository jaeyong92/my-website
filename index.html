  <h1>Welcome to my personal website.</h1>
  <p>I’m Jae-Yong, but you can call me Jae.</p>

<h2>Focus</h2>
<p>It's not the best technology that wins, it's the best process. This is why <span class="stabilo">the organization <i>is</i> the product</span>. Adversaries can copy or steal a design, but they can't replicate a superior organization's ability to execute. I build the operational engine that makes an organization superior - a resilient system designed to deliver and <span class="stabilo">sustain a decisive advantage</span>.</p>

<p>If you're working on hard operational problems in national security, <a href="mailto:jaeyong.lee@alum.mit.edu">I'd like to hear from you</a>.</p>

<h2>Foundation</h2>
<ul>

<li><b>Operations Mindset</b>: My professional approach is built on the discipline I learned while growing up in a family of classical musicians and was forged during <span class="stabilo">my service in the Swiss Armed Forces</span>. This experience gave me an intimate understanding of military life, including its culture, its operational realities, and the logic that shapes them. It trained me to think about building <span class="stabilo">resilient systems</span> - a perspective that applies not only to my work as an operations leader but to the urgent challenge of <span class="stabilo">strengthening America's strategic and industrial resilience</span>.

<p><li><b>Global Perspective</b>: As a third-culture kid now based in New York City - via Seoul, Zurich, Beijing, London, Boston, and San Francisco - I navigate complex international environments and operate effectively across cultures. My past experiences in high-stakes international settings, from security work at a refugee center during the 2011 Arab Spring to serving as a <span class="stabilo">diplomatic attaché in Beijing</span>, have sharpened this perspective. <span class="stabilo">My fluency in five languages</span> (English, French, German, Korean, and Mandarin) provides a nuanced understanding of global geopolitics, while my time in Beijing offered a firsthand view of statecraft: how governments operate, <span class="stabilo">how intelligence drives policy</span>, how foreign policy is executed, and the strategic interests that define great power competition.

</ul>

<h2>Track Record</h2>
<ul>
<p><li><b>Current</b>: VP Operations at <a href="https://www.thordynamics.com/" target="_blank">Thor Dynamics</a>. I lead operations strategy and build the company's operational engine. This work, spanning from manufacturing and supply chain to finance and compliance, delivers our critical technology to the warfighter while meeting the rigorous demands of our government partners.
<p><li><b>Formerly</b>: diplomatic service in Beijing, venture investing in robotics, co-founding a data science company, and operations and strategic finance at <a href="https://www.rivian.com/" target="_blank">Rivian</a>.
</ul>

<h2>Other</h2>
<ul>
<p><li><b>Education</b>: MIT Sloan MBA with a heavy focus on operations management; alum of the University of St. Gallen, with study abroad at Tsinghua University. I majored in business and information systems, but it was my political science courses - particularly in comparative political economy - that most shaped my career path.
<p><li><b>Miscellaneous</b>: Clarinetist, certified personal trainer, and former amateur boxer.</p>
